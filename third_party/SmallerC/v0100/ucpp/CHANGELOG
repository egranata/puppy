Changes by Alexey Frunze for Smaller C:
* break the code down into more translation units to reduce
  pressure on Smaller C's tables keeping track of declarations
  (arith.c used to be #include'd, it's not anymore)
* break some of long expressions down into smaller expressions
  or even separate statements and turn a few function-like
  macros into simple helper functions
* redefine for Smaller C the following macros in config.h:
  NATIVE_SIGNED, NATIVE_UNSIGNED, NATIVE_UNSIGNED_BITS,
  NATIVE_SIGNED_MIN, NATIVE_SIGNED_MAX
* clean up most of the warnings showing up with gcc (mostly
  about potentially uninitialized or unused variables)
* adjust Makefile (not tested, not used with Smaller C anyway)
* add a workaround (@-files) for short command lines in DOS
* drop AMIGA support
* drop special casing for DOS/Windows paths:
  * DOS and Windows support both kind of slashes in file APIs,
    e.g. "c:\foo.txt", "dir/foo.txt" and "c:/dir\foo.txt", so
    there's no need to convert \ into /
  * this incorrectly brings "A:" through "z:" DOS/Windows paths
    as absolute paths to non-DOS/Windows systems, but it should
    be much less of a problem/inconvenience than having to
    compile the preprocessor differently for different systems
* support both "-Dmacro"/"-Umacro" and "-D macro"/"-U macro"
  similar to "-Ipath"/"-Jpath" and "-I path"/"-J path"

ucpp-1.3.2
* Fixed Issue 8, Included files missing  a "terminating carriage
  return character" will interrupt preprocessing in sample.c/LEXER
  mode.

ucpp-1.3.1
* Fixed Issue 5, "\r\n" carriage return characters are double
  counted.
  (http://code.google.com/p/ucpp/issues/detail?id=5)		
* Fixed Issue 6, Included files missing a "terminating carriage
  return character" will interrupt preprocessing in ucpp
  (STAND_ALONE mode).
  (http://code.google.com/p/ucpp/issues/detail?id=6)
* Fixed Issue 7, STD_MACROS & STD_ASSERTS undefined when trying to
  build ucpp -DSTAND_ALONE.
  (http://code.google.com/p/ucpp/issues/detail?id=7)
* Build ucpp & libucpp with 'make'.

ucpp-1.3
* Original import into svn at code.google.com/p/ucpp
